TODO:

- Move FA to local dependancy
- favicon and title
- left corner logo and site link
- github link in bottom if scrolling/paging can be made to work better
- Word order search
- Possibly metaphone or similar
- Better solution for the clear icon. The margin pixel hack feels sucky.
- Change hit limitation to infiniscroll
